## Research Methodology Steps
The dissertation follows a structured time-series analysis workflow starting with data collection from official sources like the Reserve Bank of India's DBIE for 10-year GSEC yields (1997–2024 monthly) and quarterly fiscal deficit data interpolated to monthly via Quadratic Match Sum method for consistency with GDP rebasing. Macroeconomic variables—inflation (WPI log-differences), industrial production (IIP log-differences), exchange rate (INRUSD log-levels), trade balance (import-export ratio log-levels), and repo rate (levels)-were selected to capture fiscal-monetary interactions, external risks, and economic activity influencing bond yields.​

Data cleaning involved base-year adjustments for structural breaks, logarithmic transformations for trending series (WPI, IIP), and stationarity checks via Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron tests; fiscal deficit and repo showed stationarity in levels (PP-confirmed), while others required differencing or log-levels to avoid spurious regressions. No explicit seasonality adjustment is detailed, but 12-lag VAR selection accounts for monthly patterns like annual cycles.​

Autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) implicitly guide lag selection, though not plotted; criteria like AIC, SC, HQ, FPE, and LR tests favored 12 lags for monthly data dynamics, validated by stability (AR roots inside unit circle), no serial correlation (LM test p>0.05 across lags 1–12), and homoskedasticity (White test p=0.76).​

## VAR Model and Macroeconomic Linkages
The VAR(p=12) model specifies, with endogenous variables: GSEC10 (dependent), FD (key explanatory), and controls (WPI, LDIIP, LIMEXP, LFX, REPO) to trace fiscal shocks amid broader macro influences without priors. Logically, FD links to yields via crowding-out (higher borrowing demand raises rates), but interacts with REPO (monetary tightening offsets), WPI (inflation expectations), LDIIP (growth signals), LIMEXP/LFX (external pressures on rupee/debt sustainability). Granger causality shows no individual significance (p>0.05) but joint predictability (p=0.039), emphasizing interconnected macro drivers over isolated FD effects.

## Key Findings
Variance decomposition (VDC, Cholesky-ordered) reveals GSEC10 variance starts own-shock dominated (100% at horizon 1, ~64% at 24), with REPO rising to 16%, WPI/IIP to 4–7%, FD to ~3%-indicating fiscal contributes modestly long-term amid monetary/inflation dominance. Impulse response functions (IRF) show insignificant GSEC10 response to FD shocks (bands include zero), transient significance from WPI/IIP short-run, but none from REPO/LIMEXP/LFX-aligning with Indian evidence of muted fiscal transmission post-controls.

## Conclusion and Policy Logic
Findings confirm persistent but insignificant FD impact on yields once macro variables are included, supporting fiscal-monetary coordination over isolated deficit cuts; e.g., RBI repo anchors yields despite FD rises. Policy implies discipline for confidence without over-relying on FD for yield control, as macro interplay (inflation/growth/external) dominates-extending to non-linearities/breaks in future work. This connects logically: FD shocks propagate via loanable funds but weaken against countervailing REPO/WPI forces in India's institutional context (SLR, RBI interventions).
